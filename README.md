# Who Is - Yandere? ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yandere-%23FF5D00)

Technical server administrator & Minecraft backend developer.
I focus on stability, performance, and fixing what breaks under load.

I work mostly with public Minecraft servers as a hobby, maintaining backend logic, proxy setups, and server cores.
My main goal is simple: make servers run smoother and stay online longer ⚙️

## What I do

- Optimize Minecraft servers for performance & TPS
- Maintain and debug backend-side issues
- Work with proxies and multi-server environments
- Configure and adapt gameplay plugins for real server use
- Solve problems that appear only in production 😄
